# Shepherd Writeup for draft-ietf-httpbis-http2-tls13

## 1. Summary

Mark Nottingham is the Document Shepherd; Barry Lieba is the responsible Area Director.0

This document updates HTTP/2 to prohibit TLS 1.3 post-handshake authentication, as an analog to
existing TLS 1.2 renegotiation restriction.

Its intended status is Proposed Standard.


## 2. Review and Consensus

This document was prepared when Working Group members noticed that the restrictions for post-handshake authentication in HTTP/2, which were designed with the constraints of TLS 1.2 in mind, no longer were necessary for TLS 1.3.

Therefore, this is a very short update to address that. It has wide support amongst the working group, including from implementers.
