    <abstract>
      <t>
        This specification allows HTTP CONNECT requests to indicate what
        protocol will be used within the tunnel once established, using the
        ALPN header field.
       </t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        The HTTP CONNECT method (<xref target="RFC7231" x:fmt="of" x:sec="4.3.6"/>)
        requests that the recipient establish a tunnel to the identified origin
        server and thereafter forward packets, in both directions, until the
        tunnel is closed. Such tunnels are commonly used to create end-to-end
        virtual connections, through one or more proxies.
      </t>
      <t>
        The HTTP ALPN header field identifies the protocol or protocols that the
        client intends to use within a tunnel that is established using CONNECT.
        This uses the Application Layer Protocol Negotiation identifier (ALPN,
        <xref target="RFC7301"/>).
      </t>
      <t>
        For a tunnel that is then secured using <xref
        target="RFC5246">TLS</xref>, the header field carries the same
        application protocol label as will be carried within the TLS handshake
        <xref target="RFC7301"/>.  If there are multiple possible application
        protocols, all of those application protocols are indicated.
      </t>
      <t>
        The ALPN header field carries an indication of client intent only.  An
        ALPN identifier is used here only to identify the application protocol
        or suite of protocols that the client intends to use in the tunnel.  No
        negotiation takes place using this header field.  In TLS, the final
        choice of application protocol is made by the server from the set of
        choices presented by the client.  Other substrates could negotiate the
        application protocol differently.
      </t>
      <t>
        Proxies do not implement the tunneled protocol, though they might choose
        to make policy decisions based on the value of the header field.  For
        example, a proxy could use the application protocol to select
        appropriate traffic prioritization.
      </t>

          The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
          "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

   <section title="The ALPN HTTP Header Field" anchor="tp">
      <t>
        Clients include the ALPN header field in an HTTP CONNECT
        request to indicate the application layer protocol that will be used within
        the tunnel, or the set of protocols that might be used within the
        tunnel.
      </t>

      <section title="Header Field Values">
        <t>
          Valid values for the protocol field are taken from the
          "Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) Protocol ID" registry
          (<eref target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-extensiontype-values/#alpn-protocol-ids"/>)
          established by <xref target="RFC7301"/>.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Syntax">
        <t>
          The ABNF (Augmented Backus-Naur Form) syntax for the ALPN
          header field is given below.  It is based on the Generic Grammar
          defined in <xref x:sec="2" x:fmt="of" target="RFC7230"/>.
        </t>
        <figure>
          <artwork type="abnf2616"><![CDATA[
ALPN = 1#protocol-id
protocol-id     = token ; percent-encoded ALPN protocol identifier
]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>
          ALPN protocol names are octet sequences with no additional constraints
          on format. Octets not allowed in tokens (<xref target="RFC7230"
          x:fmt="," x:sec="3.2.6"/>) MUST be percent-encoded as per <xref
          x:fmt="of" x:sec="2.1" target="RFC3986"/>.  Consequently, the octet
          representing the percent character "%" (hex 25) MUST be
          percent-encoded as well.
        </t>
        <t>
          In order to have precisely one way to represent any ALPN protocol
          name, the following additional constraints apply:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              Octets in the ALPN protocol MUST NOT be percent-encoded if they
              are valid token characters except "%", and
            </t>
            <t>
              When using percent-encoding, uppercase hex digits MUST be used.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          With these constraints, recipients can apply simple string comparison
          to match protocol identifiers.
        </t>
        <figure>
          <preamble>
            For example:
          </preamble>
          <artwork type="message/http; msgtype=&#34;request&#34;" x:indent-with="  ">
CONNECT www.example.com HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
ALPN: h2, http%2F1.1
</artwork>
        </figure>
      </section>

      <section title="Usage">
        <t>
          For a CONNECT tunnel that conveys a TLS session that in turn
          encapsulates another protocol, the value of the ALPN header field
          contains the same list of ALPN identifiers that will be sent in the
          TLS ClientHello message <xref target="RFC7301"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Where no protocol negotiation is expected to occur, such as in
          protocols that do not use TLS, the ALPN header field contains a single
          ALPN Protocol Identifier corresponding to the application protocol
          that is intended to be used.  If an alternative form of protocol
          negotiation is possible, the ALPN header field contains the set of
          protocols that might be negotiated.
        </t>
        <t>
          When used in the ALPN header field, the ALPN identifier and registry
          are used to identify an entire application protocol stack, not a
          single protocol layer or component.

        HTTP header fields are registered within the "Permanent Message Header
        Field Names" registry maintained at <eref
        target="https://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers"/>.  This
        document defines and registers the ALPN header field, according to <xref
        target="RFC3864"/> as follows:
        <list style="hanging">

            http
          </t>
          <t hangText="Status:">
            Standard
          </t>
          <t hangText="Reference:">

          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        In case of using HTTP CONNECT to a TURN server ("Traversal Using Relays
        around NAT", <xref target="RFC5766"/>) the security considerations of
        <xref target="RFC7231" x:fmt="of" x:sec="4.3.6"/> apply. It states that
        there "are significant risks in establishing a tunnel to arbitrary
        servers, particularly when the destination is a well-known or reserved
        TCP port that is not intended for Web traffic. Proxies that support
        CONNECT SHOULD restrict its use to a limited set of known ports or a
        configurable whitelist of safe request targets."
      </t>
      <t>
        The ALPN header field described in this document is OPTIONAL. Clients
        and HTTP proxies could choose to not support it and therefore either
        fail to provide it, or ignore it when present. If the header field is
        not available or ignored, a proxy cannot identify the purpose of the
        tunnel and use this as input to any authorization decision regarding the
        tunnel. This is indistinguishable from the case where either client or
        proxy does not support the ALPN header field.
      </t>
      <t>
        The value of the ALPN header field could be falsified by a
        client.  If the data being sent through the tunnel is encrypted (for
        example, with <xref target="RFC5246">TLS</xref>), then the proxy might
        not be able to directly inspect the data to verify that the claimed
        protocol is the one which is actually being used, though a proxy might
        be able to perform traffic analysis <xref target="TRAFFIC"/>.  A proxy
        therefore cannot rely on the value of the ALPN header field
        as a policy input in all cases.
