## Draft HTTP  Extension Specifications

This is the working area for the [IETF HTTPbis Working
Group](https://httpwg.github.io/) draft extensions.

## Contributing

See [Contributing.md](our contribution guidelines) for information about how to
participate.

**Be aware that all contributions to the specification fall under the "NOTE WELL" terms outlined below.**


## Working With the Drafts

If you're an editor, or forking a copy of the draft, a few things to know:

* Pushing to the master branch will automatically generate the HTML on the
  gh-pages branch.
* You'll need xml2rfc, Java and Saxon-HE available. You can override the
  default locations in the environment.  On a Mac with
  [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), "saxon-b" is the right package.
* For some drafts, you will need [kramdown-rfc2629](https://github.com/cabo/kramdown-rfc2629)
* Some of the make targets require GNU Make 4.0
* Making the txt and html for the latest drafts is done with "make".
