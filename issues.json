Then pass the bytes to a crypto library that does know details such as the tag length for a given alg.\r\n\r\nThis spec doesn't absolutely need alg agility as other algs would define their own content-encoding label.

   "body": "Current spec is using Golomb-coded sets as the algorithm to create digests.\r\n\r\nWhile they show great space-efficiency, Golomb-coded sets do not enable O(1) removal from the digest, which means from a browser implementation perspective, the browser would have to calculate the hash for each host upon connection creation.\r\n\r\nThat poses a couple of issues from an implementation perspective:\r\n\r\n* Calculating the hash on each connection establishment may be expensive. That part seems inherent to the algorithm and not likely to be optimized away.\r\n* Calculating the hash requires per-host indexing. That part is just a limitation of many current cache implementations.\r\n\r\nA cache digest algorithm that enables O(1) removal (as well as addition) to the digest would enable us to move away from those limitations:\r\n\r\n* Browsers can calculate a per-host digest once, then keep updating it as resources are added to the cache as well as when resources are removed from the cache. No need for per-host indexing.\r\n  -  In order to do that, browsers would need to persist digests along with the cache\r\n* Upon connection establishment, the browser can just send the ready-made digest to the server. Win!\r\n\r\nDuring the HTTPWS, counting bloom filters were mentioned as an O(1) removal algorithm, but they are extremely inefficient when it comes to space. (~4 times bigger than bloom filters)\r\n\r\nTurns out, [Cuckoo filters](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~binfan/papers/login_cuckoofilter.pdf) enable O(1) removal while being more space efficient than bloom filters. While they are slightly bigger than Golomb-coded sets based digests, the cheaper runtime costs can make up for that deficiency.\r\n\r\n/cc @kazuho @mnot @cbentzel @mcmanus\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The entire gamut of possible solutions is broad, and we haven't had much luck in reaching clarity here.\n\nOne the one end of the scale, it should be perfectly OK to send a request for an `http` origin over an authenticated TLS connection.  But we still have the (entirely legitimate) concern there is that some servers might get themselves confused by this.\n\nThe other end of the scale is the bells and whistles JSON stuff.  @mcmanus seemed OK with this based on his implementation experience, but it is a little complicated.  We found too many corner cases for me to be happy that it implementations wouldn't end up busted.  And now that we insist on authentication for the server, many of the features didn't make sense.\n\nWe've also considered an HTTP/2 setting.  That's appealing, but it does limit the applicability a little.\n## This proposal\n\nThis change aims more to the conservative end of that scale.  It keeps the `/.well-known/` resource, but simplifies it, reducing it to a flat list of origins.  The client only needs to acquire this from the authenticated server.\n\nThis doesn't defend against Alt-Svc attacks mounted by attackers with the ability to both send header fields and run an authenticated server, but we're in a very strange place if this is the sort of capabilities we ascribe to our attackers in our threat models.\n## Other changes\n\nI've explicitly added `http/1.1` here.  I believe that's reflective of consensus, but that part is easy to revert.\n\nThe text about client certificates is now clearer.\n",

Thus third-party cookies function properly for many use cases. I would like to suggest adding this policy to the discussion of examples in RFC6265 section 7.1, \"Third-party cookies.\" After the sentence, \n\n> Others refuse to process the Set-Cookie header in responses to third-party requests.\n\nit might be of helpful to add something like\n\n> Still others store third-party cookies loaded by different first-party domains into separate cookie databases, to prevent cross-site tracking.\n",

The notion of alt-svc has always been that it is a shortcut route (or dns name if your prefer) for the same content as supplied at the default origin. If for any reason you cannot get there, you can always go back to the default origin. All of the machinery around this (validating alternates, etc) can happen transparently and asynchronously in the background until they are ready to be used. A mechanism that requires a characteristic of a route (auth'd TLS) but not the route itself doesn't play well - its far too easy to brick your site for an extended period of time and really ceases to be opportunistic in any meaningful sense. If you're up to managing this, then you're probably up to the fight of running https:// and using HSTS which at least has the benefit of not bringing a whole second technology (alt-svc) into play.\n\n[there is further discussion on list]\n",

   "body": "As per recent discussion, this draft should advise readers about whether or not it should be used for new headers, or new parameters on existing headers.\n\nStraw-man:\n- Change the Abstract to:\n\n> RFC5987 defines an encoding for non-ASCII payloads in HTTP header field value parameters, based upon the encoding defined in RFC2231. This document updates that definition and describes how it should (and should not) be used.\n- Change the first paragraph of Introduction to:\n\n> By default, header field values in HTTP messages ([RFC7230]) cannot directly carry characters outside the US-ASCII coded character set ([RFC0020]). RFC 2231 ([RFC2231]) defines an encoding mechanism for use in MIME headers. This specification documents a subset of that encoding that has been used in some HTTP header fields. Its use in new header fields, or new parameters on existing header fields, is NOT RECOMMENDED.\n- Remove section 4 contents (and subsections), replace with:\n\n> The convention defined by this specification allows a parameter fields that have two possible encodings (ASCII without the `*`, UTF-8 with it). This causes considerable complication in the use and implementation of those parameters, since they now have to handle both, and all of the possible permutations and edge conditions implied by this (e.g., how a header field value with both ought to be handled).\n> Furthermore, this encoding can only be used in parameter values, not in other parts of header field values.\n> As a result, use of this encoding is only RECOMMENDED where already defined; new header fields, as well as new parameters on existing header fields, SHOULD NOT use it when non-ASCII content is anticipated. Instead, they SHOULD mandate a character encoding of UTF-8, combined with escaping of non-ASCII characters using a well-defined convention (e.g., percent encoding, as per [RFC3986).\n- Optionally, move the existing contents of section 4 into an appendix, but clarify that they're there merely for the benefit of existing uses.\n",

   "body": "Based on the various discussion at [IETF](https://github.com/httpwg/wg-materials/blob/gh-pages/ietf96/minutes.md#jfv), HTTP Workshop, and [mailing lists](https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/httpbisa/current/msg26788.html), JFV may not be the right long-term \"replacement\" header encoding format. However, while [sketches are being pushed around](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2016JulSep/thread.html#msg292), it's not clear if and when such a format will come either\u2026 In the meantime, I believe we can shape JFV (with minor modifications) into a format that is immediately useful and addresses many of the current pain points for **new** header fields. Specifically: \n- UA's want a reusable and tested parser. Today we end up hand-rolling parsers for most every field (due to ABNF quirks, past implementation mistakes, etc), which leads to interop problems, security issues, and so on. Also, this is not a Chrome specific problem, all major UA's have the same pain points, and we all need to do better.\n- At the same time, all UA's have well-tested JSON parsers. Reusing existing code helps cut down on attack surface area, helps with interop, etc. As such, JFV format is a strong plus.\n- JSON parsers are easy to come by on the server side and all the same benefits and motivation is just as applicable.\n\nThat said, as others have already pointed out, we do need additional restrictions on JFV beyond what is currently in the spec. Also, it just so happens that browsers already follow the [ECMA-262 spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html), which addresses most of the  raised concerns:\n- Specify how to deal with repeated fields:\n  - [InternalizeJSONProperty(holder, \n    name)](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-internalizejsonproperty): \n    _\"In the case where there are duplicate name Strings within an object, \n    lexically preceding values for the same key shall be overwritten.\"_ All \n    browsers already do this.\n- Specify number encoding format\n  - [4.3.20 Number \n    value](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-terms-and-definitions-number-value): \n    Number value is primitive value corresponding to a double-precision 64-bit \n    binary format IEEE 754-2008 value.\n  - [11.8.3 Numeric \n    Literals](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-literals-numeric-literals)\n- Specify date encoding format\n  - [20.3.1.16 Date Time String \n    Format](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-date-time-string-format), \n    [Date.parse()](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-date.parse)\n    - We can require ISO 8601 Extended format.\n- Specify character encoding\n  - UTF-8 [[RFC3629](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3629)]\n\nAre there other issues that were brought up that are not addressed above? \n\nMy proposal is that we update JFV to spec above ECMA-262 restrictions and requirements. Doing so would enable UA's to adopt JFV with minimal work.\n\n_p.s. in progress specs and browser features that plan on leveraging JFV: [Clear-Site-Data](https://www.w3.org/TR/clear-site-data/), [Feature Policy](http://wicg.github.io/feature-policy/), [Reporting](http://w3c.github.io/reporting/), [Network Error Logging](http://w3c.github.io/network-error-logging/), \u2026 and I'm sure we'll see more soon._\n\n/cc @reschke @mnot @mcmanus \n",

   "body": "In [section 3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-cookie-alone-00#section-3), after the line \"Before step 11, execute the following step\", the new step intentionally ignores the path.  A note says that \"The intent is to allow the 'secure' flag to supercede the 'path' restrictions to protect sites against cookie fixing attacks.\"  However this change breaks backwards compatibility in the following common scenario:\n1. https://example.com/login/ sets a Secure cookie named SESSIONID with the path /login/.\n2. http://example.com/foo/ sets a non-secure cookie named SESSIONID with the path /foo/, which will be ignored.\n\nThis is the cause of https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=580770.  If the draft is adopted as currently written, it will effectively force any website that hosts secure and insecure applications under the same host name to rename cookies in each application to avoid conflicts.  To date, using path provided sufficient scoping to avoid cross-application conflicts.\n\nEven if the second cookie was allowed to be set in the scenario above, it would not have resulted in a fixation vulnerability because one path was not a path-match of the other.  It might be possible to fine-tune the algorithm to only block non-secure cookies if and only if a secure cookie already exists that is a [path-match](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-5.1.4) of the insecure cookie.  However, that assumes that the cookie order algorithm in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-5.4 is changed from SHOULD to MUST, and that servers only trust the first cookie.  It also wouldn't help improve backwards compatibility in this scenario:\n1. https://example.com/ sets a Secure cookie named SESSIONID with the path /.\n2. http://example.com/foo/ sets a non-secure cookie named SESSIONID with the path /foo/, which will be ignored.\n\nBoth the draft as written, and the path-match variant proposed above suffer from fixation attacks when an HTTP resource is visited first.  There are other ways that these types of attacks can be mitigated without breaking backwards compatibility, and cover more attack scenarios, at the expense of being opt-in by the server.  These might include the __Secure- prefix (assuming no one is using this in the wild), or introducing a new cookie header, like Cookie-Attributes, that servers could inspect to determine whether or not to trust a cookie.\n",

Is the scope limited to the resources referenced in the stream and the client would have to keep a data structure around for every page?\n\nThere are a few cases where I can see issues with scoping on hostnames:\n1. If a user goes to www.example.com, you might want to expand the cache digest to all of the resources for example.com.\n2. The first point doesn't make sense for a site like Tumblr where there are many blogs for *.tumblr.com and creating a digest might become large.  Having a limit on the number of items in the digest and having the most used items in the cache digest might help.\n3. There are also issues for sites where there are multiple domain names referenced by the stream and being served by the same connection.  This will happen with finance.yahoo.com where it has s.yimg.com resources and they are served by the same server.\n\nFor reference:\n\"A CACHE_DIGEST frame can be sent from a client to a server on any stream in the \"open\" state, and conveys a digest of the contents of the client's cache for associated stream.\"\n",

Or only send them after an origin has opted-in with a .well-known/http-encryption response\nover a strongly authenticated connection?\n\nThe risk comes from an unauthenticated active adversary Alt-Svc'ing a client to a server\nto which the client is sending client certs for HTTPS but where the server is not\nmulti-scheme aware and hasn't opted in.  There is the potential for the server to\nhave a perception of HTTPS client-cert authenticated requests when the client may\nbe thinking it is making HTTP requests which may have had some cookies\nor other elements injected by the active MitM under the cleartext HTTP side.\n\nFrom @martinthomson on http-wg discussion:\n\n> I would be happy saying that you can't use client certs.

In particular, Section 3 seems to add some confusion about whether \"reasonable assurances\" and \"server authentication\" are the same thing or not but then 5.2 sometimes uses \"authenticated without \"strongly authenticated\".  For example, this paragraph is not particularly crisp on what the requirements are (strong authentication or something else):\n\n```\nA commitment is not bound to a particular alternative service.\nClients are able to use alternative services that they become aware\nof.  However, once a valid and authenticated commitment has been\nreceived, clients SHOULD NOT use an unauthenticated alternative\nservice.  Where there is an active commitment, clients SHOULD ignore\nadvertisements for unsecured alternative services.  A client MAY send\nrequests to an unauthenticated origin in an attempt to discover\npotential alternative services, but these requests SHOULD be entirely\ngeneric and avoid including credentials.\n```\n",

In order to do this incrementally, an ORIGIN frame would need to be additive -- each successive frame augmenting the client's list of allowed domains.  However, we still need to support the original case, scoping it down.\n\nI'd suggest changing the semantics to be additive and defining a flag whose presence/absence means that the existing list (initially inferred from the certificate) be discarded before processing this frame.\n",

An implementation that \nis serving an opportunistically secured request SHOULD suppress these \nsignals for http resources.\n\nHTTP/1.1 MUST NOT be used to serve opportunistically secured requests. \nHTTP/1.1 can be used to discover an opportunistically secured \nalternative service.\"\n\nThe problem remains that this is not really specific to HTTP/1.1; for \ninstance, code running inside Apache over HTTP/2 may have exactly the \nsame problem (Stefan E. to confirm); so it's more a matter of HTTP \nserver internal APIs, not the on-the-wire protocol.\n\nI believe this needs to be rephrased to better explain the actual \nproblem; and I also remain unconvinced that the conclusion wrt HTTP/1.1 \nmakes sense.\n",

The presence of the resource indicates support for cross-port Alt-Svc without strong authentication.  The presence of a commit member, however, indicates that only strongly-authenticated alternatives should be used (effectively, opting out of the weaker mode).\n\nHowever, since the commitment to strong auth has an explicitly stated lifetime, while the consent to cross-port doesn't, it's possible for the end result to be that a client believes the server has consented to weak cross-port alternatives after the commitment has expired.\n\nSeveral reasonable solutions exist:\n- Move the duration out to an explicit \"lifetime\" member which details the time for which the entire structure can be treated as valid; \"commit\" would effectively become a flag.\n- HTTP caching semantics might be used for the same purpose; \"commit\" still becomes a flag\n- Explicitly state a desired mode of behavior (strong-auth only, same-host only, same-host or strong auth, etc.) and optionally a lifetime.  This is harder to extend in the future, but may be the clearest today.\n",

   "body": "The resolution to #144 implies that the client can trust Alt-Svc headers from the server after finding a .well-known/http-opportunistic resource, but doesn't explain why that should be.\n\nLogically, the attack described depended on the attacker's ability, from hosted content, to inject a value for the Alt-Svc header.  The original solution in the Alt-Svc draft, saying that servers just shouldn't allow this, placed a retroactive requirement on servers that don't support Alt-Svc.  This well-known URI represents a clear signal that the server _does_ support Alt-Svc.\n\nI suggest we add the requirement that servers which advertise the .well-known/http-opportunistic resource MUST prohibit setting the Alt-Svc from unprivileged content.  This is a reasonable implication from the current state of the text, but is not explicitly stated and could easily be missed by a server implementer.\n",

It appears that all browsers nowadays allows cookies without key or (in case of Safari) without value, thus making it de facto standard. However, it's debatable how cookies like `foo;` should be treated: as the cookie without value or without key. Thinking of cookie jar as some kind of key/value store makes it more logical to treat such cookie as cookies without value, but on the other hand, currently most implementers treats them as the cookies with the special empty key.\n",

This needs to be more precisely defined in order to not cause interoperability problems between browsers.\n\nI know that there's a tension between not sending too much header data which is commonly not used by servers, thus wasting bandwidth, while also sending enough information that servers can optimize their responses. However leaving the decision out of the spec and up to clients, doesn't make the problem simpler, it just pushes it onto someone else.\n\nWhat I propose is the following:\nFor \"document\" loads, i.e. when browsers make the request during navigation, send the information which is typically needed for websites to determine what markup to serve. So things that let the server choose which version of a responsive-design page to serve first. I'd think this includes things like \"viewport-width\", \"downlink\" and \"save-data\". (We might also want to send other information like, is the device touch-enabled, but that's a separate discussion I think).\n\nFor non-\"document\" loads, serve no CH headers by default and instead let the \"document\" response opt in to which headers should be served for the non-\"document\" requests within that document.

   "body": "The spec currently says that if a server sends `Accept-CH: DPR`, then the `DPR` header should be added \"to all subsequent requests\".\n\nHowever it is (as far as I can tell) completely undefined what a \"subsequent request\" is. Does it affect only future requests to the server which sent the `Accept-CH` header? If the header is sent with the response during a document load, does it affect all requests coming from that document, no matter which server the request goes to?\n\nGenerally speaking, if a CDN which servers images has to send a `Accept-CH: DPR` header before it will receive any `DPR` headers, that means that the first image will have to be served without DPR information. This seems unfortunate since ideally the first image that a page loads is the most important image.\n\nA better solution is that when a browser loads a \"document\" and receives a `Accept-CH` header in the response, that header would affect all the requests that are made from that document, no matter which server the request is going to. If desired, in the future we could add more complex syntax to `Accept-CH` which enables opting in to certain CH headers only for certain servers and/or only for certain resource types.\n\nWe could also add a header which enables a server to opt in to getting specific CH headers for all future requests to that same server. To for example allow an image server to opt in to certain headers even if the document-serving server has not yet adopted the `Accept-CH` header. But I'm not sure how popular such a solution would be given first-load the problem mentioned above.\n",

Server responds with an alternate response based on advertised preference (e.g. a \"light\" version of the page, an image with higher compression ratio, etc). \n   - In addition to the `Content-Length` of the response, the server wants to advertise the \"Original content length\" of the response that would have been provided if the preference was not there.\n\nIn the context of `Save-Data` this is to enable user-reporting for amount of bytes saved - e.g. since you've enabled this mode, the browser fetched 100MB, which is 40% less than if you had this disabled.\n\nPopular proxies (e.g. Chrome's Data Saver) already do this via `X-Original-Content-Length`: the proxy reports the content length of before and after applying its optimization. Other popular proxy implementations offer similar functionality (Opera, Yandex, etc). It would be nice to have a standard way to do this, and to enable origins to report this as well. \n\nRelated discussions: \n- https://github.com/igrigorik/http-client-hints/pull/42\n- https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!searchin/blink-dev/alternate/blink-dev/lj7wSXPBPWE/fE5UGl_2y1QJ\n",

Alt-Svc Parameter Registry\n> \n> The HTTP Alt-Svc Parameter Registry defines the name space for the cache directives. ...\n\nIs the intention that parameters should only be used as cache directives, as implied by the above sentence? The two parameters specified in the Draft (\"ma\" and \"persist\") are certainly of that flavour. Or is the intention that parameters could be used for other purposes as well?\n\nIf the latter, perhaps the language in section 7.3 could be softened, e.g.\n\n> The HTTP Alt-Svc Parameter Registry defines the name space for parameter names. ...\n\nThe text at Section 3 currently launches into the following with no preamble:\n\n> # 3.  The Alt-Svc HTTP Header Field\n> \n> ...\n> This specification defines two parameters: \"ma\" and \"persist\", defined in Section 3.1.  Unknown parameters MUST be ignored, that is the values (alt-value) they appear in MUST be processed as if the unknown parameter was not present.\n> New parameters can be defined in extension specifications (see Section 7.3 for registration details).\n> ...\n\nHow about inserting a sentence along the following lines:\n\n> Each \"alt-value\" MAY be followed by a semicolon-separated list of additional parameters, each such \"parameter\" comprising a name and a value. This specification defines two parameters...\n\nOr, if you want to constrain the use of parameters in any way, you could do that here.\n",

This phrasing implies that a specific-URL DMCA type notice is\nrequired before the status may be used.\n\nIt would be a lot more reasonable to also allow the status to be used\nwhen a blanket law requirement was levelled on the operator. For example\nschools following laws on porn fitering, or national level restrictions\non categories of traffic. In cases like these operators dont receive\nper-resource demands, they often receive a one-off notice \"law X applies\nto you\" and are then expected to censor proactively to the best of their\nability and face the court on overlooked URLs.\n\nProbably this can be resolved with s/legal demand/legal requirement/.\n\nThere are other \"legal demand\" phrase uses elsewhere to keep in sync.\n\nIf \"legal demand\" is being used with a meaning other than a specific\nwarrant DMCA takedown etc. Then that definitely needs to be explained.\n",

Sure, I can\u2019t change the host because I don\u2019t have the server cert, but I can change ports without that requirement.\n\nThe guidance in 9.1 just says \u201cdon\u2019t let people do that,\u201d which is easier said than done on systems that already exist.  People can run apps listening on ephemeral ports, and people can control their home pages.  With this combination, everyone else's home pages can be hijacked unless the server admin reads this draft before any students do and promptly prohibits pages from emitting headers named Alt-Svc.\n\nThe way to partially fix this is to require strong auth for changes of port as well.

Point me to a TLS-enabled endpoint, and the specific protocols we'll use will be negotiated in real-time.\n\nHowever, this does pose a challenge if you wanted _only_ HTTP/3 traffic going to your alternate.\n",

I am writing a parser for ALTSVC header\nfields and wish to ignore unknown parameters.  However, it is unclear\nto me whether a parameter without \"=value\" should be ignored or\ntreated as malformed.\n\ndraft-ietf-httpbis-alt-svc-06 Section 3 refers to \"parameter\".\nSection 1.1 says \"parameter\" is defined in RFC7230.  In fact, RFC7230\nhas \"transfer-parameter\" but not \"parameter\".  Also, RFC7230 Section\nsays \"Parameters are in the form of a name or name=value pair.\",\nimplicilty allowing names without values, but in the next line\n\"transfer-parameter\" is defined as a name=value pair, which disallowes\nnames without values.  On the other hand, RFC7231 Section 3.1.1.1\ndefines \"parameter\" as a name=value pair, but this is not what\ndraft-ietf-httpbis-alt-svc-06 refers to.\"\n",

   "body": "The current Alt-Svc-Used indicator is a boolean (\"0\"/\"1\"), due to the desire to preserve privacy.\nBased on some explorations of how this would be implemented on the server side, we realized that this doesn't provide enough information to distinguish between the different use-cases for Alt-Svc.  In particular, a server would have no way to know if just the protocol was changed, or if both the protocol and host were changed.  If we start using multiple Alt-Svc sources (such as DNS) this also becomes relevant.\n\nAn option short of including (proto,host,port) in Alt-Svc-Used would be to include a better indicator of how the Alt-Svc was used.  This could be either a bitmask or a string of tokens.  For example, with a bitmask:\n- 1 = Alt-Svc was used to change protocol  (ie, service proto != default origin scheme's proto)\n- 2 = Alt-Svc was used to change port     (ie, service port != origin port)\n- 4 = Alt-Svc was used to change host    (ie, service host != origin host)\n- 8 = Alt-Svc was obtained via Alt-Svc header\n- 16 = Alt-Svc was obtained via ALTSVC frame\n- 32 = Alt-Svc was obtained via DNS record  (reserved, not yet defined)\n\nWith a token approach, short character strings could replace the bitmask.\nIn either case this would result in a value like:\n\n  Alt-Svc-Used: 20\n  Alt-Svc-Used: h,f\n\nFor load-balancing, this would make it possible to infer the (proto,host,port) that may have been used in cases where it differs by use-case but is consistent within a use-case.\n\nThis would also significantly help with debuggability on the server side.\n### Editorial\n\nRegardless of how this is resolved, there is still text referring to previous Alt-Svc-Used indicator proposals that should be cleaned up to be consistent with whatever we decide on.  For example, with the current text the following is confusing and should be removed:\n\n>   To reduce the ability of servers to track individual clients over time (see <xref\n>   target=\"tracking\"/>), an alternative service indication sent by a client &SHOULD-NOT; include\n>   any alternative service information other than the protocol, host and port.\n\n(as the protocol, host, and port aren't part of what is being sent in the current indication).\n\nThe same applies of the \"Tracking Clients Using Alternative Services\" section which may be a remnant from previous versions.\n\nThe current text also mentions a \"token\" in the Alt-Svc-Used definition, but does not explain it or specify how it might be used or set.\n",

This document doesn't define any such checks, though clients\n>  could be configured with a policy that defines what is acceptable.\n\nis very unclear for a server implementer (as well as clients).  If authentication doesn't succeed, should the client fail-back to clear-text (the origin) or hard fail?\n\nOne possibility (which may start getting outside of the editorial realm) is for an Alt-Svc parameter indicating that authentication will not be present (either via an unauthenticated cipher suite or a mismatching cert).  This would allow clients to chose to ignore the Alt-Svc rather than following it and erroring or needing to fall-back).  For example:\n\n```\n Alt-Svc: h2=\":443\" ; unauth\n```\n",
