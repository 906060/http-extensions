This phrasing implies that a specific-URL DMCA type notice is\r\nrequired before the status may be used.\r\n\r\nIt would be a lot more reasonable to also allow the status to be used\r\nwhen a blanket law requirement was levelled on the operator. For example\r\nschools following laws on porn fitering, or national level restrictions\r\non categories of traffic. In cases like these operators dont receive\r\nper-resource demands, they often receive a one-off notice \"law X applies\r\nto you\" and are then expected to censor proactively to the best of their\r\nability and face the court on overlooked URLs.\r\n\r\nProbably this can be resolved with s/legal demand/legal requirement/.\r\n\r\nThere are other \"legal demand\" phrase uses elsewhere to keep in sync.\r\n\r\nIf \"legal demand\" is being used with a meaning other than a specific\r\nwarrant DMCA takedown etc. Then that definitely needs to be explained.",

   "body": "The current Alt-Svc-Used indicator is a boolean (\"0\"/\"1\"), due to the desire to preserve privacy.\r\nBased on some explorations of how this would be implemented on the server side, we realized that this doesn't provide enough information to distinguish between the different use-cases for Alt-Svc.  In particular, a server would have no way to know if just the protocol was changed, or if both the protocol and host were changed.  If we start using multiple Alt-Svc sources (such as DNS) this also becomes relevant.\r\n\r\nAn option short of including (proto,host,port) in Alt-Svc-Used would be to include a better indicator of how the Alt-Svc was used.  This could be either a bitmask or a string of tokens.  For example, with a bitmask:\r\n\r\n* 1 = Alt-Svc was used to change protocol  (ie, service proto != default origin scheme's proto)\r\n* 2 = Alt-Svc was used to change port     (ie, service port != origin port)\r\n* 4 = Alt-Svc was used to change host    (ie, service host != origin host)\r\n* 8 = Alt-Svc was obtained via Alt-Svc header\r\n* 16 = Alt-Svc was obtained via ALTSVC frame\r\n* 32 = Alt-Svc was obtained via DNS record  (reserved, not yet defined)\r\n\r\nWith a token approach, short character strings could replace the bitmask.\r\nIn either case this would result in a value like:\r\n\r\n  Alt-Svc-Used: 20\r\n  Alt-Svc-Used: h,f\r\n\r\nFor load-balancing, this would make it possible to infer the (proto,host,port) that may have been used in cases where it differs by use-case but is consistent within a use-case.\r\n\r\nThis would also significantly help with debuggability on the server side.\r\n\r\n### Editorial ###\r\n\r\nRegardless of how this is resolved, there is still text referring to previous Alt-Svc-Used indicator proposals that should be cleaned up to be consistent with whatever we decide on.  For example, with the current text the following is confusing and should be removed:\r\n\r\n>   To reduce the ability of servers to track individual clients over time (see <xref\r\n>   target=\"tracking\"/>), an alternative service indication sent by a client &SHOULD-NOT; include\r\n>   any alternative service information other than the protocol, host and port.\r\n\r\n(as the protocol, host, and port aren't part of what is being sent in the current indication).\r\n\r\nThe same applies of the \"Tracking Clients Using Alternative Services\" section which may be a remnant from previous versions.\r\n\r\nThe current text also mentions a \"token\" in the Alt-Svc-Used definition, but does not explain it or specify how it might be used or set.",

   "body": "After a re-read of alt-svc and opp-sec, it may make sense to have use some better alignment between the two docs around the cases where authentication is not employed.  In particular, alt-svc indicates:\r\n\r\n>   Importantly, this includes its security context; in particular, when TLS\r\n>  <xref target=\"RFC5246\"/> is in use, the alternative server will need to present a certificate\r\n>  for the origin's host name, not that of the alternative. \r\n\r\nReplacing \"is in use\" with \"is used to authenticate\" would align that text better with opp-sec. \r\n\r\nOn the opp-sec side:\r\n\r\n>   A client MAY perform additional checks on the offered certificate if the server does not select an\r\n>  unauthenticated TLS cipher suite.  This document doesn't define any such checks, though clients\r\n>  could be configured with a policy that defines what is acceptable.\r\n\r\nis very unclear for a server implementer (as well as clients).  If authentication doesn't succeed, should the client fail-back to clear-text (the origin) or hard fail?\r\n\r\nOne possibility (which may start getting outside of the editorial realm) is for an Alt-Svc parameter indicating that authentication will not be present (either via an unauthenticated cipher suite or a mismatching cert).  This would allow clients to chose to ignore the Alt-Svc rather than following it and erroring or needing to fall-back).  For example:\r\n\r\n     Alt-Svc: h2=\":443\" ; unauth\r\n\r\n\r\n",
