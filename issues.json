This document doesn't define any such checks, though clients\r\n>  could be configured with a policy that defines what is acceptable.\r\n\r\nis very unclear for a server implementer (as well as clients).  If authentication doesn't succeed, should the client fail-back to clear-text (the origin) or hard fail?\r\n\r\nOne possibility (which may start getting outside of the editorial realm) is for an Alt-Svc parameter indicating that authentication will not be present (either via an unauthenticated cipher suite or a mismatching cert).  This would allow clients to chose to ignore the Alt-Svc rather than following it and erroring or needing to fall-back).  For example:\r\n\r\n     Alt-Svc: h2=\":443\" ; unauth\r\n\r\n\r\n"
