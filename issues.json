This phrasing implies that a specific-URL DMCA type notice is\r\nrequired before the status may be used.\r\n\r\nIt would be a lot more reasonable to also allow the status to be used\r\nwhen a blanket law requirement was levelled on the operator. For example\r\nschools following laws on porn fitering, or national level restrictions\r\non categories of traffic. In cases like these operators dont receive\r\nper-resource demands, they often receive a one-off notice \"law X applies\r\nto you\" and are then expected to censor proactively to the best of their\r\nability and face the court on overlooked URLs.\r\n\r\nProbably this can be resolved with s/legal demand/legal requirement/.\r\n\r\nThere are other \"legal demand\" phrase uses elsewhere to keep in sync.\r\n\r\nIf \"legal demand\" is being used with a meaning other than a specific\r\nwarrant DMCA takedown etc. Then that definitely needs to be explained."

    "body": "After a re-read of alt-svc and opp-sec, it may make sense to have use some better alignment between the two docs around the cases where authentication is not employed.  In particular, alt-svc indicates:\r\n\r\n>   Importantly, this includes its security context; in particular, when TLS\r\n>  <xref target=\"RFC5246\"/> is in use, the alternative server will need to present a certificate\r\n>  for the origin's host name, not that of the alternative. \r\n\r\nReplacing \"is in use\" with \"is used to authenticate\" would align that text better with opp-sec. \r\n\r\nOn the opp-sec side:\r\n\r\n>   A client MAY perform additional checks on the offered certificate if the server does not select an\r\n>  unauthenticated TLS cipher suite.  This document doesn't define any such checks, though clients\r\n>  could be configured with a policy that defines what is acceptable.\r\n\r\nis very unclear for a server implementer (as well as clients).  If authentication doesn't succeed, should the client fail-back to clear-text (the origin) or hard fail?\r\n\r\nOne possibility (which may start getting outside of the editorial realm) is for an Alt-Svc parameter indicating that authentication will not be present (either via an unauthenticated cipher suite or a mismatching cert).  This would allow clients to chose to ignore the Alt-Svc rather than following it and erroring or needing to fall-back).  For example:\r\n\r\n     Alt-Svc: h2=\":443\" ; unauth\r\n\r\n\r\n"
